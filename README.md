Deploying a Multi-Tier Website in PHP Using AWS

1.Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a multi-tier architecture website built in PHP on AWS. It emphasizes scalability, fault tolerance, and security using various AWS services. The architecture comprises a web tier, an application tier, and a database tier, each hosted on separate layers to optimize performance and manageability.

2.Architecture Overview

Components:

3.Web Tier:

a) Hosted on EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

b) Serves static content and routes dynamic requests to the application tier.

4.Application Tier:

a) Contains PHP application logic.

b) EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group for scalability.

5.Database Tier:

a) Amazon RDS (MySQL) for secure and reliable database management.

Security Components:

*Custom VPC with public and private subnets.

*Security Groups and Network ACLs for access control.

*IAM roles for secure access to AWS resources.

*Tools and Technologies

5.AWS Services:

*EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling, RDS, CloudWatch, IAM, S3 (optional for asset storage).

6.Programming Language: PHP

7.Database: MySQL (via Amazon RDS)

8.Additional Tools:

*Git for version control

*Terraform/CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code (optional)

9.Setup and Deployment Steps

Step 1: Provision Infrastructure

Create a custom VPC with public and private subnets.

Set up Internet Gateway and Route Tables for connectivity.

Step 2: Configure Web and Application Tiers

Launch EC2 instances for web and application tiers in separate subnets.

Install and configure PHP, Apache/Nginx on the EC2 instances.

Deploy the PHP application code.

Step 3: Configure Database Tier

Launch an Amazon RDS instance with MySQL.

Configure security groups to allow access from the application tier.

Initialize the database schema and seed data if required.

Step 4: Configure Load Balancing and Auto Scaling

Set up an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for the web tier.

Configure Auto Scaling groups for the web and application tiers.

Define scaling policies based on CloudWatch metrics.

Step 5: Security Configurations

Implement Security Groups and Network ACLs.

Configure IAM roles and policies for instance access and resource permissions.

Step 6: Testing and Monitoring

Test the website for functionality and performance.

Use CloudWatch for monitoring metrics and setting alarms.

Optional Step: Use Infrastructure as Code

Use Terraform or CloudFormation templates to automate the setup.
